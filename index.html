								<h3>1: Study the data</h3>
								<p>
									Columns like user_name,raw_timestamp_part_1,raw_timestamp_part_2,cvtd_timestamp,new_window,num_window are control attributes that should not be included as predictors.
									There are other columns that most of their value are empty. These columns should be excluded too.
									As a result, 53 columns were picked in building the model. 
								</p>
								<xmp>
columns <- c("roll_belt","pitch_belt","yaw_belt","total_accel_belt","gyros_belt_x","gyros_belt_y","gyros_belt_z","accel_belt_x","accel_belt_y","accel_belt_z","magnet_belt_x","magnet_belt_y","gyros_arm_x","gyros_arm_y","gyros_arm_z","accel_arm_x","accel_arm_y","accel_arm_z","magnet_arm_x","magnet_arm_y","magnet_arm_z","magnet_belt_z","roll_arm","pitch_arm","yaw_arm","total_accel_arm","roll_dumbbell","pitch_dumbbell","yaw_dumbbell","total_accel_dumbbell","gyros_dumbbell_x","gyros_dumbbell_y","gyros_dumbbell_z","accel_dumbbell_x","accel_dumbbell_y","accel_dumbbell_z","magnet_dumbbell_x","magnet_dumbbell_y","magnet_dumbbell_z","roll_forearm","pitch_forearm","yaw_forearm","total_accel_forearm","gyros_forearm_x","gyros_forearm_y","gyros_forearm_z","accel_forearm_x","accel_forearm_y","accel_forearm_z","magnet_forearm_x","magnet_forearm_y","magnet_forearm_z","classe")

									3: Pre-process
								</h3>
								<p>
									Some columns are hightly correlated, pre-processing with "PCA" can be used to improve performace.

									4: cross-valiadtion
								</h3>
								<xmp>
									ctrl <- trainControl(method="oob", number=10,repeats=1)	
								</xmp>	
								<p>
									I have tried "cv" and "oob", then chose "oob" for cross-validation method since it was a little bit more accurate.

									Set fold to 10 made to speed up training time while still generating a very accurate result.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>5: Model</h3>
								<xmp>
									ctrl <- trainControl(method="oob", number=10,repeats=1)
									rf <- train(classe ~., data=training, method="rf", preProcess="pca", trControl=ctrl)
								</xmp>	
								<p>
									The model was chosen to be random forest for the following reason
									<ul>
										<li>
											This is a classifcation problem
										</li>
										<li>
											Random forest is very accurate
										</li>
										<li>
											It has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing.<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm">*</a>	
										</li>
									</ul>

								<h3>6: Expected out of sample error</h3>
								<img src="rf.jpg"/>
								<p>
									
									The training time was less than 3mins on a 3 Cores + 14G RAM windows 8.1 hyper-v virtual machine.
									The finalModel had oob estimate 2.94%.
									I have also tried repeats = 5, number =20. The oob was improved little but training time increased significatenly.

								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>7: Predict on splitted testing data</h3>
								<img src="testing.jpg"/>
								<p>
									The accuracy on testing set was 97.27%
